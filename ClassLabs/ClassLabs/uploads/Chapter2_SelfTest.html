1. What is a method?

- JavaScript methods are the actions that can be performed on objects.
  It is a property containing a function definition.
  
- It is procedures associate with an object, 

- objectName.methodName()



2. What is a function?

- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

- Must be contained within a script element

- function myFunction(p1, p2) {
    return p1 * p2;              // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
    }
	
	
	
3. What is an anonymous function?

- It works only where they are located in code, 
- You can use it for code that runs only once


4. What are parameter and argument?

- Parameter is a variable used within a function. 
- They are listed inside the parentheses() in the function definition. 


- Arguments are actual parameters. They are variables places in the function call statement parentheses. 
  함수 호출할때 아규먼트라고 한다!!!! 함수(파라메터)  ← 호출할 때 파라메터를 아규먼트라고 한다.
- f(x) x는 7   x는 파라메터, 7은 아규먼트라고

- Argument value assigned to the corresponding parameter value in the function definition. 

 
- They are values received by the function when it is invoked. 

- Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables!!!!!!


5. How to call functions?

- To execute a named function, you must invoke, or call it. 

- You can use 'Event Handler' to call functions

// slide 10 

//1) Specify function as value for HTML attribute (onEVENT)
<input type="submit" onclick="showMessage()" >

<input type ="submit"> // 서브밋 Submit 버튼이 생긴다
<input type="number"> // 숫자 입력창이 생긴다 
<input type="text"> // 텍스트 입력창이 생긴다 
<button id="submit"> submit </button> // 서브밋 submit 버튼이 생긴다

<script>

//2) Specify function as property value for object
document.getElementById("submitButton").onclick =showMessage;



//3) Use addEventListener() method
var a = document.getElementById("submitButton");
a.addEventListener("click", showMessage, false);

// This is most flexible - separate HTML and JavaScript code, enables you to specify several event handler for a single event. 

</script>

6. How can you find error location with browser?
- Since unintentional coding mistakes keep code from working, you need to find where they are. You can find them in browser console pane
- CHROME: CTRL + SHIT + J (or F12)

7. What is return statement?

- We can return <function value> to a calling statement
= Return statement returns  a value to the statement (which is ) calling the function (같은말) 


8. What is the difference between local scope and global scope?

- Variable scope is the place (or range) where variable can be used.

- Global variable is declared outside a function and it is available (affects) to all parts of code

- Local variable is declared inside a function, so only available within the function where it is declared.
So, when the function ends, the scope cease to exit. 
- Keyword var is required !!!! If var is not included, the variable automatically becomes a global variable!!! (very confused!!!)

     
// slide 17

<script>
document.write("<br>");



var color = "blue";

function slide17(){

color="red";
document.write(color);

}

console.log(color); //blue
document.write(color); //blue

document.write("<br>");
slide17(); //red

</script>


// slide 18

<script>

document.write("<br>");
document.write("*** with Var ***");
document.write("<br>");

var color = "green";

function slide18withVar() {

   var color = "purple";
   document.write(color); 
   
}

document.write(color); // green

slide18withVar();// purple

document.write(color) // green

document.write("<br>");

var color = "green";

document.write(color);//green

slide18withVar();//purple

document.write(color); // purple

document.write("<br>");

document.write("<p>");





document.write("*** without Var *** ");
document.write("<br>");

var color = "green";

function slide18withoutVar() {

   color = "purple";
   document.write(color); 
   
}

document.write(color); // green

slide18withoutVar();// purple

document.write(color) //purple

document.write("<br>");

var color = "red";

document.write(color);//red

slide18withoutVar();//purple

document.write(color); // purple


</script>


9. Please list at least 3 built-in JavaScript function

- parseInt(string) : convert string into integer
- parseFloat(string) : convert string into floating point number
- isNaN(number): determines whether a value is the special value NaN


10. What is primitive types?

* Javascript has five primitive data types

- number
- Booliean : true or false
- string
- undefined
- null : empty value
- Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6)

Anything that doesn’t belong to any of these six primitive types is considered an object.
BUT each of these five primitive data types has a corresponding object constructor

READ : http://vicfriedman.github.io/blog/2013/09/15/the-difference-between-javascript-primitive-data-types-and-objects/

Object refers to a data structure containing data and instructions for working with the data. 
Objects sometimes refer to real-world things, for example a car or map object in a racing game. 
JavaScript, Java, C++, Python, and Ruby are examples of object-oriented programming languages.


11. What is null and undefined?

- The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value.(= It doesn't contain any data)

- Undefined variable never had a value, never been declared or assigned a value : not even null.

12. What is escape characters and sequence?

- Escape character is backslash(\) in Javascript. It tells the complier or interpreter that
the character followed has a special purpose
ex) \n : new line

13. Arithmetic Operators

14. What is the difference between binary operator and unary operator?
- Binary operator requires an operand before and after operator. 
ex) Arithmetic binary operators: +, -, *, /, %


- Unary operator requires a single operand either before or after the operator. 
ex) Increment unary operator: ++
    Decrement unary operator: --
	Postfix (i++) and prefix(++i), both increase the i variable by one but return different value.

	var studentID = 100;
	var curStudentID;
	
	curStudentID=++studentID; //101
	document.write("<p> The first student ID is " + curStudentID + "</p>");
	
	curStudentID=++studentID; //102
	document.write("<p> The second student ID is " + curStudentID + "</p>");
	
	curStudentID=++studentID; //103
	document.write("<p> The third student ID is " + curStudentID + "</p>");
